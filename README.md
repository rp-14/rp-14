# 👋 Hi, I’m @rp-14

I'm a **Senior Software Developer** with over **4 years of experience** in building reliable, scalable, and maintainable software. My journey in software development is marked by my passion for solving complex problems, optimizing performance, and implementing best practices across different domains and tech stacks. I hold a degree from **IIIT Allahabad**, which laid the groundwork for my technical expertise and logical problem-solving approach.

### 🛠️ Core Skill Set and Tech Stack

#### 🌐 Back-End Development
My primary expertise lies in backend development, where I specialize in:
- **Python (Django):** Expertise in building RESTful APIs, custom middleware, ORM, and asynchronous task management with Celery. I focus on creating clean and reusable code to support modular and scalable architectures.
- **Ruby on Rails:** Skilled in Ruby and Rails framework for creating MVC-based applications. I have experience in managing database schema changes, implementing ActiveRecord queries efficiently, and ensuring API and web service reliability.

#### 📱 Mobile Development
- **Kotlin (Android):** Proficient in Android application development with Kotlin, implementing MVVM architecture, dependency injection, and efficient data handling for smooth user experiences. I focus on balancing UI complexity with backend efficiency, ensuring seamless and responsive app performance.

#### 🗄️ Database Management
- **PostgreSQL:** Skilled in SQL optimization, complex joins, indexing strategies, and database design principles to ensure high-performance querying and data integrity. I have experience in data migrations, schema versioning, and implementing both transactional and analytical workflows.

### 🌱 Currently Learning
While I am proficient in the above technologies, I am continuously expanding my skill set to stay on top of industry advancements:
- **Microservices Architecture:** Exploring best practices in decoupling applications for scalability, deploying independent services, and implementing message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka) for seamless inter-service communication.
- **Cloud-Native Solutions:** Currently focused on cloud services like AWS and GCP, containerization with Docker, and orchestration with Kubernetes to enhance application deployment, monitoring, and scaling.

### 👀 Areas of Interest
I'm particularly passionate about projects that require:
- **Optimized Backend Architecture:** From performance tuning to load balancing and caching strategies, I enjoy crafting efficient server-side solutions.
- **Distributed Systems and Scalability:** I have a keen interest in creating systems that handle high concurrency and large volumes of data, ensuring high availability and reliability.
- **Data Management and Analysis:** While primarily a developer, I have a strong interest in data engineering, including database optimization, ETL processes, and analytics.

### 💼 Open to Collaboration
I'm open to collaborating on projects that:
- Tackle **high-impact, enterprise-level challenges**, such as fintech applications, healthcare solutions, or any domain where data privacy, security, and scalability are paramount.
- Focus on **open-source contributions** to give back to the community. I believe in the power of collaborative learning and shared knowledge, and I’m excited about opportunities to work on meaningful open-source projects.
- Aim to incorporate **machine learning** or **AI-driven solutions**. I am interested in exploring how predictive algorithms and intelligent automation can be integrated into traditional software to add value.
